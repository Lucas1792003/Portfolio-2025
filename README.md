# 🌟 My Web & Game Dev Journey

Hi, I’m **Wai Yan Paing** 👋  
This is my personal portfolio site — a place where I share my growth as a self-taught **web developer** and beginner **game creator**.

---

## 🚀 The Journey So Far
- 📅 **1 Year of Self-Study**  
  I started teaching myself web design and development about a year ago.  
  It began with curiosity about how websites worked and slowly grew into a real passion.

- 🎨 **From HTML & CSS to React**  
  At first, I practiced building simple static pages with HTML and CSS.  
  Later, I picked up JavaScript and React to make things interactive, responsive, and modern.

- 🎮 **Exploring Games**  
  Along the way, I started experimenting with small game projects.  
  Beginner-level stuff, but it helped me learn about logic, interactivity, and how design meets fun.

- 🛠️ **Learning by Doing**  
  I’ve been creating personal projects — both websites and little game experiments — to practice and improve.  
  Every project is a step forward, no matter how small.
